# dotfiles-void
dotfiles for Void Linux

This repo is currently an experiment:

- I use [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) to manage it
- but also strongly leverage submodules

Intent is to modularize the dotfiles to use commons and specific configurations on different distros. 

Let's see :)
